3. Setup and Installation
This application is built using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). To set it up:

Clone or Download: Obtain the project files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) and place them in a directory on your local machine.

Web Server (Optional but Recommended): For local development, you can use a simple local web server (e.g., Python's http.server, Node.js serve, or a tool like XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP). Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run python -m http.server (for Python 3) or npx serve (if you have Node.js installed).

Open in Browser: Alternatively, you can simply open the main HTML file (e.g., index.html or login.html) directly in your web browser. Note that some functionalities (like data persistence or backend interactions) might require a proper web server setup.

4. Usage
Login: Navigate to the application's URL. You will be presented with a login page. Enter your credentials to proceed.

Submit Attendance:

After successful login, you will typically land on an attendance submission form.

Enter the date, select the service type, and input the number of males, females, and children.

Click "Submit Attendance" to save the record.

View Records: Click the "View Records" button at the bottom of the page to see a table of all past attendance entries.

View Chart: Click the "View Chart" button to see a graphical representation of attendance data.

Add User: If you have administrative privileges, click "Add User" to create new user accounts.

Export to Excel: On the records page, click "Export to Excel" to download the attendance data.

Logout: Click "Logout" to end your session.

5. Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and content of the web pages.

CSS3: For styling and layout, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

JavaScript: For interactive elements, form handling, and potentially data manipulation (client-side).

Firebase Firestore (Potential): (If data persistence is implemented) For real-time database capabilities to store and retrieve attendance records.

Firebase Authentication (Potential): (If user login is implemented with Firebase) For user authentication and management.

6. Future Improvements
Backend Integration: Implement a robust backend (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask/Django, PHP) for secure data storage, user authentication, and API endpoints.

Database: Integrate with a database (e.g., Firestore, PostgreSQL, MySQL) for persistent storage of attendance records and user data.

User Roles and Permissions: Implement different user roles (e.g., Admin, Usher) with varying levels of access and permissions.

Advanced Charting: Enhance the "View Chart" functionality with more interactive and customizable charts using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

Filtering and Sorting: Add options to filter attendance records by date range, service type, or sort them by different columns.

Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to quickly find specific attendance entries.

Error Handling and Validation: Improve form validation and provide more user-friendly error messages.

Notifications: Add success/error notifications for actions like submission or deletion.

Offline Support: Consider implementing offline capabilities for data entry in areas with poor internet connectivity.
